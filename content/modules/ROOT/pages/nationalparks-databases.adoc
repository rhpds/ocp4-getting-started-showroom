= Connecting to a Database
:navtitle: Connecting to a Database

include::vars.adoc[]

In this section, you will deploy and connect a MongoDB database that the
`nationalparks` application will use to store location information.

Finally, you will mark the `nationalparks` application as a backend for the map
visualization tool, so that it can be dynamically discovered by the `parksmap`
component using the OpenShift discovery mechanism and map data will be displayed
automatically.

[#storage]
== Background: Storage

Most useful applications are "stateful" or "dynamic" in some way, and this is
usually achieved with a database or other form of data storage. In this workshop section, you are
going to add MongoDB to your application architecture, and then configure the `nationalparks` Deployment to
connect to the database. The connection parameters are provided to the Deployment using environment variables using a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret, window="_blank"].

[#create_mongodb_instance]
== Exercise: Deploy MongoDB

The first step is to create a *Secret* which is used to store senstive information such as database connection credentials.
In *Workloads* → *Secrets*, click the *Create* button in the upper right and select *From YAML*.

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_create_secret.png[link="self",window=_blank]

In the editor, paste the following YAML:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongodb-credentials
  namespace: {ocp4_starter_project}
type: Opaque
stringData:
  admin-usr: admin
  admin-pwd: secret
  app-usr: parksapp
  app-pwd: keepsafe
----

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_create_secret_dialog.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Click the *Create* button at the bottom of the form.

With the Secret in place, click the *+* icon in the upper right, as done previously for adding the other applications. Choose the *Container images* option. Fill in the following details:

* Image section:
    - Image name from external registry → `mongo:6.0.4`
    - Runtime icon → choose `mongodb`

* General section:
    - Application → `workshop`
    - Name → `mongodb`

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_deploy_image_image.png[link="self",window=_blank]

* Make sure that the drop-down for resource type is set to the *Deployment* option.

* Click *Show advanced Deployment options*.
    - Here, you'll add the following two environment variables which will be sourced from the previously created secret named `mongodb-credentials`.
    - Click *+Add from ConfigMap or Secret* and enter `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` as the name. For the value, choose `mongodb-credentials` as resource and `admin-usr` as key.
    - Again, click *+Add from ConfigMap or Secret* and enter `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` as the name. For the value, choose `mongodb-credentials` as resource and `admin-pwd` as key.

* Advanced options:
    - Create a route → *uncheck* because the database will not be accessed by clients outside the OpenShift cluster.

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_deploy_image_general.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Finally, click the *Create* button at the bottom of the page to deploy a MongoDB container.

The next step is to create a specific user in this MongoDB instance which the nationalparks application will use to create a connection. For this, click the *MongoDB Deployment* in the Topology view, then click on the corresponding *Pod* shown in the right view pane.

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_deployment_topology_pod.png[link="self",window=_blank]

You will end up in the Pod details view where you can click *Terminal* to start a terminal session in the underlying container.

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_pod_details_terminal.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Copy and paste the following snippet into the terminal window to create a database user with the proper settings and roles:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
mongosh -u admin -p secret --authenticationDatabase admin --eval 'use parksapp' --eval 'db.createUser({user: "parksapp", pwd: "keepsafe", roles: [{ role: "dbAdmin", db: "parksapp" },{ role: "readWrite", db: "parksapp" }]})' --quiet
----

NOTE: In production environments you could modify the container entrypoint or use an https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init container, window="_blank"] to manage database configuration.

If the command is successful, you'll see the output below:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
{ ok: 1 }
----

With that, everything regarding the database is prepared and you can switch your focus back to the nationalparks application. Go back to the *Topology* view, click the *nationalparks Deployment* and choose _Actions → Edit Deployment_ from the drop-down in the right view pane.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks_deployment_edit.png[link="self",window=_blank]

In the *Edit Deployment* dialog, scroll down to the *Environment Variables* section and add the following four entries. First, set the server host and the database:

    - `MONGODB_SERVER_HOST`: `mongodb`
    - `MONGODB_DATABASE`: `parksapp`

The `MONGODB_SERVER_HOST` value of `mongodb` will be resolved to the MongoDB *Service* that was created when you deployed the MongoDB container image.

The other two are credentials are sourced from the `mongodb-credentials` Secret.

Click *+Add from ConfigMap or Secret* and enter `MONGODB_USER` as the name. For the value, choose `mongodb-credentials` as resource and `app-usr` as key.

Again, click *+Add from ConfigMap or Secret* and enter `MONGODB_PASSWORD` as the name. For the value, choose `mongodb-credentials` as resource and `app-pwd` as key.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks_deployment_env_vars_secrets.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Finally, click the *Save* button at the bottom of the dialog. This will trigger a rollout of a new version of the application, which will connect the MongoDB instance you just deployed.


[NOTE]
====
You are probably wondering how the database connection magically started
working? When deploying applications to OpenShift, it is always best to create
environment variables using Secrets or ConfigMaps to define connection parameters to dependent systems. This allows
for application portability across different environments without without modifying source code. The source file that
performs the connection as well as creates the database schema can be viewed
here:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
{ocp4_starter_openshift_roadshow}/nationalparks/blob/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/db/MongoDBConnection.java#L44-l48
----

Notice that the applicaton catches the exception if the database connection is not defined? This is why you were able to deploy it without it crashing.

====

[#adding_labels]
== Exercise: Adding Labels

Next, let's fix the labels assigned to the MongoDB deployment. From the *Topology* view, select the MongoDB deployment and choose _Actions → Edit Labels_.

[.bordershadow]
image::mongodb_deployment_labels.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Like before, you'll add 3 labels:

The name of the Application group:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
app=workshop
----

Next, the name of this deployment:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
component=nationalparks
----

And finally, the role this component plays in the overall application:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
role=database
----

[#exploring_openshift_magic]
== Exercise: Exploring OpenShift Magic

After updating the `nationalparks` Deployment with the database connection environment variables, some
magic happened. OpenShift rolled out a new version of the application that uses the new variables by upating the *ReplicaSet*. You
can verify this by looking at the output of `oc get rs -l app=nationalparks`:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nationalparks-58bd4758fc   0         0         0       4m58s
nationalparks-7445576cd9   0         0         0       6m42s
nationalparks-789c6bc4f4   1         1         1       41s
----

You can see the DESIRED and CURRENT number of instances for current a prior ReplicaSets. The desired and current number of the previous instances are 0.
This means that OpenShift has gracefully replaced your previous application Pod with a new Pod that uses the new configuration.


[#data_data_everywhere]
== Exercise: Data, Data, Everywhere

Now that you have a database deployed, you can again visit the `nationalparks` web
service to query for data:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
https://nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}/ws/data/all
----

And the result?

[.console-output]
[source]
----
[]
----

Where's the data? Think about the process you went through. You deployed the
application and then deployed the database. Nothing actually loaded data
*into* the database, though.

The application provides an endpoint to do just that. Open this URL in your web browser to have make `nationalparks` application insert a sample dataset into MongoDB:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
https://nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}/ws/data/load
----

And the result?

[.console-output]
[source]
----
Items inserted in database: 2893
----

If you then go back to `/ws/data/all` you will see tons of JSON data now.

NOTE: There are some errors reported with browsers like Firefox 54 that don't properly parse the resulting JSON. It's
a browser problem, and the application is working properly.

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
https://parksmap-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}
----

There's just one thing. The main map *still* isn't displaying the parks.
That's because the frontend only tries to talk to services that have
the right *Label*.


[#working_with_labels]
== Exercise: Working With Labels

You explored how a *Label* is just a key-value pair earlier when looking at
*Services* and *Routes* and *Selectors*. In general, a *Label* is simply an
arbitrary key=value pair, for example:

* `pizza=pepperoni`
* `pet=dog`
* `openshift=awesome`

In the case of the parksmap, the application is actually querying the OpenShift
API and asking about the *Routes* and *Services* in the project. If any of them have a
*Label* that is `type=parksmap-backend`, the application knows to contact
the endpoints to query for map data.
You can see the code that does this
link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_roadshow}/parksmap-web/blob/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/rest/RouteWatcher.java#L20[in theRouteWatcher.java file,window='_blank'].

Fortunately, the command line provides a convenient way for you to manipulate
labels. `describe` the `nationalparks` service:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc describe route nationalparks
----

[.console-output]
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
Name:                   nationalparks

Endpoints:              10.1.9.8:8080
----

You can see that it already has some labels. Use `oc label` to add the label necessary for the RouteWatcher to discover the backend:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc label route nationalparks type=parksmap-backend
----

You will see something like:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
route.route.openshift.io/nationalparks labeled
----

Check your browser now by visiting the parksmap URL:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
https://parksmap-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}
----

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-databases-new-parks.png[link="self",window=_blank]

You'll notice that the parks suddenly are showing up. That's really cool!
