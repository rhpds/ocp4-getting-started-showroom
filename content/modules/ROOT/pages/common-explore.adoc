== Logging in with the OpenShift CLI

You can also log in to OpenShift using the command-line interface (CLI). Use the following command, replacing the values with your credentials:


[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
{ocp4_starter_login}
----

This will authenticate you to the cluster using your username and password.

[#command_line_interface]
== Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the
platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go
programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

In your web terminal, you have the OpenShift CLI available as you have already logged in to the cluster.
You can verify it by checking the version of the OpenShift CLI:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
Client Version: {ocp4_starter_cli_version}
Server Version: {ocp4_starter_server_version}
Kubernetes Version: {ocp4_starter_k8s_version}
----

You can also verify if you have correctly logged in to the OpenShift cluster.
[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-output]
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
{ocp4_starter_username}
----

Finally, verify that you've got the correct project(s) assigned to you:
[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc projects
----

[.console-output]
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
You have one project on this server: "Workspace ({ocp4_starter_project})".

Using project "{ocp4_starter_project}" on server "{ocp4_starter_api_url}".
