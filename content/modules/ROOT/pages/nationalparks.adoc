:navtitle: Nationalparks Backend App

include::vars.adoc[]

In this section, you're going to deploy a backend service that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`parksmap` web component that was deployed in the previous workshop sections).
The application will query for each national park's information (including its
coordinates) that are stored in a MongoDB database. This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the API can be directly used
by end users.

[#source_to_image]
== Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous workshop section, you learned how to deploy a pre-existing container
image. Now you will learn how OpenShift can build container images directly from source code in an existing Git repository. This is accomplished using the Source-to-Image project.

link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_github}/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I),window='_blank'] is an
open source project sponsored by Red Hat that has the following goal:

[source]
----
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container image and
assembling a new container image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
----

OpenShift can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms, in addition to building container images using instructions in a Dockerfile, and "custom" builds.

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this workshop, but you can find
more information about it either in the
link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_docs}/html/images/creating-images[OpenShift S2I documentation,window='_blank']
or on link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_github}/source-to-image[GitHub,window='_blank']. The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

[#creating_a_application]
== Exercise: Creating a Backend Application

The backend service that you will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `nationalparks`. This is an application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that you are going to deploy a web service that returns a JSON list of
places.

[#add_to_project]
=== Add to Project
Because the `nationalparks` component is a backend to serve data that your
existing frontend (parksmap) will consume, you are going to build and deploy it inside the existing
project that you have been using so far. 

[#using_application_code_on_git_server]
=== Using Application Code on Git Server

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

Later in the workshop, you will make a code change and then rebuild your
application. Now, let's take a look at deploying a backend service.

[#deploying_the_backend_service]
=== Deploying the Backend Service

Similar to how you used the *+* button before with an existing image, you
can do the same for specifying a source code repository.
Let's use it with a simple link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_roadshow}/nationalparks.git[Java,window='_blank'] S2I image.

In the Topology view, click the *+* button in the header, and select *Import from Git*.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-show-add-options.png[link="self",window=_blank]

The *Import from Git* workflow will guide you through the process of deploying your app based on a few selections.

Enter the following for Git Repo URL:

[source,role=copypaste,subs="attributes"]
----
{ocp4_starter_openshift_roadshow}/nationalparks.git
----

OpenShift will automatically determine the programming language used by the source code. You have the option to select an *Import Strategy*.

Click *Edit Import Strategy*.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-import-strategy.png[width=500,link="self",window=_blank]

You have three options: 

* *Devfile*: this will use link:{ocp4_starter_devfile_docs}[devfile,window='_blank'] spec to create an application stack. The repository has to contain a file named `devfile.yaml` in the devfile format.
* *Dockerfile*: this will create a container image from an existing Dockerfile in the source Git repository. 
* *Builder Image*: this will use a mechanism called Source-to-Image to automatically create a container image directly from the source code - no Dockerfile required.

Select *Builder Image* as you are going to create the container image from the source code, as discussed in the next section.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-import-strategy-build.png[link="self",window=_blank]

TIP: You could also use Dockerfile, as the repo contains a multi-stage Dockerfile. The goal of this exercise is to experience the Builder Image feature in OpenShift.

Verify that *Java* has been selected as your Builder Image, and be sure to select version *openjdk-11-ubi8* to have OpenJDK 11.

Scroll down to the *General* section. Add the following:

*Application Name* :
[source,role=copypaste]
----
workshop
----

*Name* :
[source,role=copypaste]
----
nationalparks
----

In the *Build* section, select *BuildConfig*.

In the *Deploy* section, select *Deployment*.

Under *Advanced Options*, ensure *Create a route* is *checked*. You are going to create another *Secure Route*, this time directly from this view.

Click *Show advanced Routing options*. Leave all default options, then go to the *Security* section. Check the *Secure Route* option. Under *TLS termination*, select *Edge*.

Scroll down and expand the *Labels* section to add 3 labels.

The name of the Application group:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
app=workshop
----

Next, the name of this deployment:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
component=nationalparks
----

And finally, the role this component plays in the overall application:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
role=backend
----

Click *Create* to submit.

[#monitoring-the-build]
=== Monitoring the Build

To see the build logs, in Topology view, click the `nationalparks` entry, then click on *View Logs* in the *Builds* section of the *Resources* tab.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-java-new-java-build.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Based on the application's language, the build process will be different. However, the initial build will take a few minutes as the dependencies are downloaded. You can see all of this happening in real time!

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[.console-input]
[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get builds
----

You'll see output like:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED              DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Running    About a minute ago   1m2s
----

You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc logs -f builds/nationalparks-1
----

After the build has completed successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting image to the internal OpenShift image registry
* The *Deployment* (D) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicaSet* (RS) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RS will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as the default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                        READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nationalparks-1-tkid3       1/1       Running     3          2m
nationalparks-1-build       0/1       Completed   0          3m
parksmap-57df75c46d-xltcs   1/1       Running     0          2h
----

Look again at the OpenShift web console. You will notice that the *Route* was created for you, since you enabled it when creating the application. You can see the URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[.console-input]
[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get routes
----

You should see something like the following:

[.console-output]
[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                   PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION       WILDCARD
nationalparks   nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}      nationalparks   8080-tcp        edge 
parksmap        parksmap-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}           parksmap        8080-tcp        edge        none
----

In the above example, the URL is:

[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
https://nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}
----

Since this is a backend application, it doesn't actually have a web interface.
However, it can still be used with a browser. All backends that work with the parksmap
frontend are required to implement a `/ws/info/` endpoint. To test, visit this URL in your browser:

link:https://nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}/ws/info/[National Parks Info Page,window='_blank']

WARNING: If the Pod is Running and the application is not available, please wait a few seconds and refresh the page, since you haven't configured Health Checks for it yet.

You will see a simple JSON string:

[source]
----
{"id":"nationalparks","displayName":"National Parks","center":{"latitude":"47.039304","longitude":"14.505178"},"zoom":4}
----

Earlier in the workshop, you read that:

_This is an application that performs 2D geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database_

But you don't have a database. Yet.
