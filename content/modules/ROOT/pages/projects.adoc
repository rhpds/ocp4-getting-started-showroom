Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An
OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own
resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas
and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the
application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make sure that
things in the environment are working as expected.  Don't worry if you don't
understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in detail in later labs.

== Your First Project

A project named *{ocp4_starter_project}* has already been created for you.

After logging in to the OpenShift web console, locate and select this project. Take a moment to explore the project overview.

Familiarize yourself with the Topology perspective. The Topology view offers a visual representation of the applications and their components within your project.

From the left menu, navigate to *Workloads* and then to *Topology*.

At this stage, you will not see any applications or components. As you progress through the lab, you will be able to visualize and interact with your application's components in the *Topology* view.

== Switching to Your Project in the CLI

You can also interact with your project using the command line.

In your web terminal, switch to your project using the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,shell,subs="attributes",role="execute"]
----
oc project {ocp4_starter_project}
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[.console-output]
[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
Now using project "{ocp4_starter_project}" on server "{ocp4_starter_api_url}"
----

We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs.
Get ready!
