= Automation with Pipelines
:navtitle: Automation with Pipelines

include::vars.adoc[]

In addition to the OpenShift built-in components, OpenShift Pipelines provide additional triggers and automation to pipelines thanks to link:https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/[*Tekton Triggers*,window='_blank'].

[#webhooks]
== Background: Web Hooks

Most Git repository servers support the concept of web hooks -- calling to an
external source via HTTP(S) when a change in the code repository happens.
OpenShift provides an API endpoint that supports receiving hooks from
remote systems in order to trigger builds. By pointing the code repository's
hook at the OpenShift Pipelines resources, automated code/build/deploy pipelines can be
achieved.

[#adding_triggers_to_your_pipeline]
== Adding Triggers to your Pipeline

Tekton *Triggers* enable us to configure Pipelines to respond to external events (Git push events, pull requests etc) such as Web Hooks.

Adding triggering support requires the creation of a `TriggerTemplate`, `TriggerBinding`, and an `EventListener` in our project.

image::devops-pipeline-triggers.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Let's see each component in detail:

* *TriggerTemplate*: a trigger template is a template for newly created resources. It supports parameters to create specific `PipelineResources` and `PipelineRuns`.
* *TriggerBinding*: validates events and extracts payload fields
* *EventListener*: connects `TriggerBindings` and `TriggerTemplates` into an addressable endpoint (the event sink). It uses the extracted event parameters from each TriggerBinding (and any supplied static parameters) to create the resources specified in the corresponding TriggerTemplate. It also optionally allows an external service to pre-process the event payload via the interceptor field.

Now let's create them all together for our Pipeline.
// Depending on which language you chose, you can use the following YAML files:

// ====
// *Java*

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc create -f {ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks/raw/branch/master/pipeline/nationalparks-triggers.yaml -n {ocp4_starter_project}
----

// *.NET*

// [source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
// ----
// oc create -f {ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks-dotnet/master/Pipelines/nationalparks-triggers-all.yaml -n {ocp4_starter_project}
// ----

// *Javascript*:

// [source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
// ----
// oc create -f {ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks-js/master/pipelines/nationalparks-triggers-all.yaml -n {ocp4_starter_project}
// ----

// *Python*

// [source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
// ----
// oc create -f {ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks-py/master/pipelines/nationalparks-triggers-all.yaml -n {ocp4_starter_project}
// ----
// ====

This will create a new Pod with a Route that we can use to setup our Webhook on GitHub to trigger the automatic start of the Pipeline.

In the *Topology* view, verify if a new Deployment *el-nationalparks* for the `EventListener` has ben created:

[#configuring_webhooks]
== Exercise: Configuring Gitea Web Hooks

In this section you can use a build webhook to trigger a pipeline execution every time there is a change in the nationalparks Gitea repository.

We will use the EventListener we created in the previous section to configure a webhook in Gitea. The `EventListener`` has an OpenShift `Route` exposed
that we are going to use as the URL for the webhook.

[source,role=copypaste,subs=attributes]
----
http://el-nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}/
----

Once you have the URL copied to your clipboard, navigate to the code repository
that you have on Gitea:

link:{ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks[Gitea Repository,window='_blank']

Sign-in using the button on the top right of the screen.

Your Gitea credentials are:

[source,subs=attributes]
----
username: {ocp4_starter_gitea_user}
password: {ocp4_starter_gitea_password}
----

Click the Settings link on the top right of the screen:

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-codechanges-settings.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Click on *Webhooks*, then the *Add Webhook* button, and finally select *Gitea*.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-codechanges-add-webhook.png[link="self",window=_blank]

In the next screen, paste your link into the "Payload URL" field.

Change the `Content Type` to `application/json`.

Finally, click on *Update Webhook*.

[.bordershadow]
image::nationalparks-codechanges-config-webhook.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Boom! From now on, every time you commit new source code to your Gitea
repository, a new build and deploy will occur inside of OpenShift. Let's try
this out.

[#using_webhooks]
== Exercise: Using Gogs Web Hooks

Next, we will use Gitea to edit a file, commit and push the changes.

Let's open the `BackendController.java` file
link:{ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks/src/branch/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/rest[located here in the gitea repository,window='_blank'].

This is the url location in case you want to copy and paste it into your browser:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
{ocp4_starter_gitea_url}/{ocp4_starter_gitea_user}/nationalparks/src/branch/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/rest
----

Once you have the file on the screen, click the edit button in the top right
hand corner as shown here:

image::nationalparks-codechanges-change-code.png[Webhook]

Change line number 20:

[source]
----
return new Backend("nationalparks","National Parks", new Coordinates("47.039304", "14.505178"), 4);
----

To

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
return new Backend("nationalparks","Amazing National Parks", new Coordinates("47.039304", "14.505178"), 4);
----

Click on Commit changes at the bottom of the screen. Feel free to enter a commit
message.

Once you have committed your changes, a *Build* should almost instantaneously be
triggered in OpenShift. From the *Topology* view, click `nationalparks` and look at the *Builds* section of the *Resources* tab, or, run the
following command to verify:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get builds
----

You should see that a new build is running:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED          DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Complete   18 hours ago     36s
nationalparks-2   Source    Git@3b26e1a   Running    43 seconds ago
----

Once the build and deploy has finished, verify your new image was
automatically deployed by viewing the application in your browser:

link:http://nationalparks-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}/ws/info/[National Parks Info Page,window='_blank']

You should now see the new name you have set in the JSON string returned.

NOTE: To see this in the map's legend itself, you will need to scale down your parksmap to 0, then back up to 1 to force the app to refresh its cache.
