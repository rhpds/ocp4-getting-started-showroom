[#routes]
== Background: Routes

While *Services* provide internal abstraction and load balancing within an
OpenShift environment, sometimes clients (users, systems, devices, etc.)
**outside** of OpenShift need to access an application. External clients access applications running in OpenShift through the
OpenShift routing layer, which can be configured using a *Route* object.

The default OpenShift router (https://www.haproxy.org/[HAProxy, window="_blank"]) uses the HTTP header of the incoming
request to determine where to proxy the connection. You can optionally define
security, such as TLS, for the *Route*. If you want your *Services*, and, by
extension, your *Pods*, to be accessible from the outside world, you need to
create a *Route*.

== Exercise: Creating a Route

You may remember that when you deployed the `parksmap` application, you unchecked the checkbox to 
create a *Route*. Normally it would have been created automatically. Fortunately, creating a *Route* is a straightforward process. 

You can create a Route either from the OpenShift Console or using the `oc` CLI. Use one of the options below to choose your desired approach for adding the route.

====
*OPTION A: OpenShift Console:*

. Click *Networking -> Routes* and then the *Create Route* button.
. Insert *parksmap* in *Name* field.
. From *Service* field, select *parksmap*. For *Target Port*, select *8080*.
. In *Security* section, check *Secure route*. Select *Edge* from *TLS Termination* list.
. Leave all other fields blank and click *Create*:

TIP: The TLS certificate for cluster Apps domains is used by default, so you don't need to add any certificate. If you want to use a custom domain resolving to your OpenShift cluster, you can add certificates on a per-route basis.

When creating a *Route*, you can specify other options, such as the hostname and path for the *Route* or additional TLS configurations.

*OPTION B: `oc` Command Line:*

To `expose` the *Service*, first verify that you don't already have any existing *Routes*:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get routes
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
No resources found.
----

Now you need to get the *Service* name to expose:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get services
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
parksmap   172.30.169.213   <none>        8080/TCP   5h
----

Once you know the *Service* name, creating a *Route* is a simple one-command task:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create route edge parksmap --service=parksmap
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
route.route.openshift.io/parksmap created
----

====

Verify the *Route* was created with the following command:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get route
----

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
NAME       HOST/PORT                                                           PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
parksmap   parksmap-{ocp4_starter_project}.{ocp4_starter_apps_domain}          parksmap   8080-tcp   edge          None
----

You can also verify the *Route* in the *Topology* view under the *Resources* tab for your `parksmap` Deployment. Note that there is now an arrow icon on the `parksmap` node in the Topology. If you click that, it will open the URL for your *Route* in a browser.

The application is now available at the URL shown in the Developer Perspective. Click the link and you will see it.

NOTE: If this is the first time opening this page, the browser will ask permission to get your position. This is needed by the frontend app to center the world map to your location. If you don't allow it, the app will use a default location.
