== What is OpenShift?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[OpenShift,window='_blank'] is a container-based application platform that enables development teams to deploy, manage, and scale their applications across any infrastructureâ€”whether on-premises, public cloud, or hybrid environments.

== What is a Container?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container-vb[Containers,window='_blank'] are a standardized way to package applications along with all their dependencies. This approach simplifies deployment and accelerates delivery. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not include an entire operating system. Only the application, runtime, libraries, and configuration are packaged inside the container. This makes containers a more lightweight, portable, and efficient deployment model compared to virtual machines.

Building on this container foundation, link:https://openshift.com/[OpenShift,window='_blank'] enables efficient application development by providing a complete platform that streamlines workflows and includes validated integrations - making it ideal for development teams looking to accelerate their projects and organizations looking for a standardized application platform.
