include::vars.adoc[]

Almost every interaction with an OpenShift environment that you can think of
requires going through the OpenShift's control plane API. All API interactions are both authenticated (AuthN - who are you?) and authorized (AuthZ - are you allowed to do what you are asking?).

In the logging section, you saw an
error related to a *Service Account*.

As OpenShift is a declarative platform, some actions will be performed by the platform and not by the end user issuing a command. These actions are performed using a *Service Account* which is a special type of `user` that the platform will use internally.

OpenShift automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project.
The **default** service account is responsible for running the Pods, and OpenShift automatically injects this service account into
every Pod that is launched. By changing the permissions for that service
account, you can enable additional functionality.

To view current permissions in the web console, go to the {ocp4_starter_console_url}/topology/ns/{ocp4_starter_project}[Topology view, link="self",window=_blank], click the `parksmap` entry, go to the *Details* tab, and then click the *Namespace*.

Select the *Role Bindings* tab and filter by *Namespace Role Binding* to see all permissions for the selected project.

[#grant_serviceaccount_view_permissions]
== Exercise: Grant Service Account View Permissions
The parksmap application wants to talk to the OpenShift API to learn about other
*Pods*, *Services*, and resources within your *Project*. You'll soon learn why!

The parksmap application runs as a *Service Account* in your project on the cluster: namely the `default` *Service Account*. You can grant the necessary `view` access to this *Service Account* to allow it to query the API and see what resources are within the *Project*. This addresses the cause of the error message you saw previously in the logs.

Choose one of the options below - either *OpenShift Console* or *`oc` command line* â€” to update the `default` *Service Account* in the `{ocp4_starter_project}` project:

====
*OPTION A: OpenShift Console:*

. Go to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *{ocp4_starter_project}*, then *Role Bindings* and then click the *Create Binding* button.
+

+
. Configure the following fields: Role Binding Name: *view*, Namespace: *{ocp4_starter_project}*, Role Name: *view*, Subject: *Service Account*, Subject Namespace: *{ocp4_starter_project}*, Subject Name: *default*.
+
image::parksmap-permissions-membership-serviceaccount-edit.png[link="self",window=_blank]
+
. Once you're finished editing permissions, click on the *Create* button. You should then be able to see the new `view` item in the *RoleBindings* list for the `{ocp4_starter_project}` project.

*OPTION B: `oc` command line:*

First, confirm you're in the right project context:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc project {ocp4_starter_project}
----

Then use the `oc policy add-role-to-user` command to grant the predefined `view` role to the service account:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view -z default
----

.What does the `-z` flag do?
****
From the `-h` output on `oc policy`:

[source]
----
-z, --serviceaccount=[]: service account in the current namespace to use as a user
----

The `-z` syntax is a special one that saves us from having to type out the
entire string, which, in this case, is
`system:serviceaccount:{ocp4_starter_project}:default`. It's a nifty shortcut.
****

NOTE: The `-z` flag will only work for service accounts in the *current* project. If you're referring to a service account in a different project, use the `-n <project>` switch.

====

[#redeploy_application]
== Exercise: Redeploy Application

Use the `oc rollout` command to restart the `parksmap` application. This will create a new Pod.

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rollout restart deployment/parksmap
----

A new deployment is immediately started. Return to Topology view and click the `parksmap` entry again to watch it happen. The deployment happens quickly, but you can see the change reflected in the *ReplicaSet* number. You can also use the `oc get pods` command to see that the new Pod has an age that's just a few seconds old.

If you check the application logs you should see no errors.
