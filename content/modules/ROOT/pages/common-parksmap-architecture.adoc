This section introduces you to the architecture of the ParksMap application, which you'll use throughout this workshop. Understanding the architecture will help you better unsderstand the tasks you'll perform from a developer's perspective. ParksMap is a polyglot geo-spatial data visualization application built using a microservices architecture. It consists of multiple services developed using different programming languages and frameworks.

The main service is a web application with two key components:

1. **Server-side component**: Aggregates geo-spatial APIs provided by multiple independent backend services.
2. **Client-side component**: Built with JavaScript, it visualizes geo-spatial data on the map and communicates with the server-side using WebSockets to update the map in real-time.

You'll deploy a set of independent backend services that provide various mapping and geo-spatial information, including:

* Worldwide National Parks
* Major League Baseball Stadiums in North America

The original source code for this application is located link:{ocp4_starter_roadshow_url}[here,window=_blank].

The server-side component of the ParksMap web application acts as a communication gateway to all available backends. These backends are dynamically discovered using service discovery mechanisms provided by OpenShift, which will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
