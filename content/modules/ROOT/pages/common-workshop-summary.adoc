This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to OpenShift from a developer's perspective. Through practical, interactive exercises, you'll learn how to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications on the OpenShift platform.

== What You'll Learn

**Getting Started with OpenShift:**

* Use the OpenShift command line client and web console
* Navigate the OpenShift developer interface and understand key concepts

**Application Deployment and Management:**

* Deploy applications using pre-existing container images
* Deploy applications directly from source code in Git repositories
* Work with application labels to identify and organize components
* Scale applications to handle varying traffic loads

**Networking and Access:**

* Expose applications to external users through routes
* Configure application networking and service discovery

**Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

* View and analyze application logs for debugging
* Access application containers for direct interaction and troubleshooting

**Database Integration:**

* Deploy databases from the OpenShift service catalog
* Configure applications to connect to and use databases

**Collaboration and Automation:**

* Grant access to other users for collaborative development
* Set up webhooks to enable automated application builds from code changes

NOTE: While this workshop uses Java applications, the concepts and techniques apply to applications built with .NET, Node.js, Python, and other runtimes.
