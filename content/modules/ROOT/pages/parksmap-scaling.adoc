[#deployments_and_replication_controllers]
== Background: Deployments and ReplicaSets

While *Services* provide routing and load balancing for *Pods*, which may go in and out of existence, *ReplicaSets* (RS) and *ReplicationControllers* (RC) are used to specify and ensure the desired number of *Pods* (replicas) are running. For example, if you want your application server to always run 3 *Pods* (instances), a *ReplicaSet* is needed. Without an RS, any *Pods* that are killed or exit are not automatically restarted. *ReplicaSets* and *ReplicationControllers* provide self-healing in OpenShift. *Deployments* control *ReplicaSets*, while *ReplicationControllers* are controlled by *DeploymentConfigs*.

From the link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_docs}/html/building_applications/deployments[deployments documentation,window='_blank']:

Similar to a replication controller, a ReplicaSet is a native Kubernetes API object that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. The difference between a replica set and a replication controller is that a replica set supports set-based selector requirements whereas a replication controller only supports equality-based selector requirements.

In Kubernetes, a *Deployment* defines how something should be deployed. In almost all cases, you will use *Pod*, *Service*, *ReplicaSet*, and *Deployment* resources together. OpenShift will create all of them for you when you deploy container images using the web console or CLI.

There are some advanced scenarios where you might want some *Pods* and a *ReplicaSet* without a *Deployment* or a *Service*. If you are interested in these cases, ask your instructor after the workshop.

[#exploring_deployment_related_objects]
== Exercise: Exploring Deployment-related Objects

Now that you know the background of *ReplicaSets* and *Deployments*, explore how they work together. Take a look at the *Deployment* that was created when you instructed OpenShift to deploy the `parksmap` image:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get deployment
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
parksmap   1/1     1            1           20m
----

To get more details, look into the *ReplicaSet* (RS):

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get rs
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
parksmap-65c4f8b676   1         1         1       21m
----

This output shows that you currently expect one *Pod* to be deployed (`Desired`), and you have one *Pod* actually deployed (`Current`). By changing the desired number, you can tell OpenShift that you want more or fewer *Pods*.

TIP: OpenShift's *HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)* can monitor the CPU and memory usage of a set of Pods and can update the RCs to ensure application stability by adding more instances. You can learn more about link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_docs}/html/nodes/working-with-pods#nodes-pods-autoscaling[Horizontal Pod Autoscalers in the documentation,window='_blank'].

[#scaling_the_application]
== Exercise: Scaling the Application

In this exercise, you will scale the parksmap application up to 2 instances. You can do this with the `oc scale` command or by incrementing the Desired Count in the OpenShift web console. Choose the method you prefer.

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc scale --replicas=2 deployment/parksmap
----

Alternatively, you can scale up to two pods in the *Developer Perspective*. From the Topology view, click the `parksmap` Deployment config and select the *Details* tab:

[.bordershadow]
image::parksmap-details.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Next, click the *^* icon next to the Pod visualization to scale up to 2 pods.

[.bordershadow]
image::parksmap-scaleup.png[link="self",window=_blank]

To verify that you changed the number of replicas, issue the following command:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get rs
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
parksmap-65c4f8b676   2         2         2       23m
----

You can see that you now have 2 replicas. Verify the number of pods with the `oc get pods` command:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-65c4f8b676-fxcrq   1/1     Running   0          92s
parksmap-65c4f8b676-k5gkk   1/1     Running   0          24m
----

Lastly, verify that the *Service* accurately reflects two endpoints:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc describe svc parksmap
----

You will see output resembling the following. Notice that the *Service* now targets two *Endpoints*:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
Name:              parksmap
Namespace:         user1
Labels:            app=workshop
                   app.kubernetes.io/component=parksmap
                   app.kubernetes.io/instance=parksmap
                   app.kubernetes.io/part-of=workshop
                   component=parksmap
                   role=frontend
Annotations:       openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftWebConsole
Selector:          app=parksmap,deployment=parksmap
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                172.30.22.209
Port:              8080-tcp  8080/TCP
TargetPort:        8080/TCP
Endpoints:         10.128.2.90:8080,10.131.0.40:8080
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
----

Another way to look at a *Service*'s endpoints is with the following:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get endpoints parksmap
----

You will see output resembling the following example:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME       ENDPOINTS                           AGE
parksmap   10.128.2.90:8080,10.131.0.40:8080   45m
----

Your IP addresses will likely be different, as each Pod receives a unique IP within the OpenShift environment. The endpoint list is a quick way to see how many pods are behind a service.

You can also see that both *Pods* are running in the Developer Perspective:

[.bordershadow]
image::parksmap-scaled.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Overall, that's how simple it is to scale an application. Application scaling can happen extremely quickly because OpenShift is launching new instances of an existing image, especially if that image is already cached on the node that the new Pod is https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/[scheduled on, window="_blank"].

[#application_self_healing]
== Application "Self Healing"

Because OpenShift's *RSs* are constantly monitoring to see that the desired number of *Pods* are running, you might expect OpenShift to "fix" the situation if the desired replica count doesn't match the current number.

Since you have two *Pods* running right now, you can see what happens if you "accidentally" kill one. Run the `oc get pods` command again, and choose a *Pod* name. Then, do the following:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete pod parksmap-7dfd599cd7-vgc7z && oc get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source]
----
pod "parksmap-65c4f8b676-k5gkk" deleted
NAME                        READY   STATUS            RESTARTS     AGE
parksmap-65c4f8b676-bjz5g   1/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s
parksmap-65c4f8b676-fxcrq   1/1     Running             0          4m48s
----

Did you notice anything? One container has been deleted, but a new container is already being created in its place.

Additionally, OpenShift provides rudimentary capabilities around checking the liveness and/or readiness of application instances. If the basic checks are insufficient, OpenShift also allows you to run a command inside the container in order to perform the check. That command could be a script that uses any installed language.

Based on these health checks, if OpenShift decided that your `parksmap` application instance wasn't healthy, it would delete the instance and then create a new one in its place, always ensuring that the desired number of replicas was in place.

More information on probing applications is available in the
link:{ocp4_starter_openshift_docs}/html/building_applications/application-health[Application Health,window='_blank'] 
section of the documentation and later in this guide.

[#scale_down]
== Exercise: Scale Down

Before we continue, go ahead and scale your application down to a single
instance. Feel free to do this using whatever method you like.

WARNING: Failure to scale down to 1 Pod will cause unexpected behavior in later sections. This is due to how the application has been coded, and not related to OpenShift.
