The exercises in this workshop have shown you how OpenShift can be used not only for deploying
stateless web applications, but also applications which require persistent
file system storage.

This flexibility makes OpenShift an ideal platform for deploying both web
applications and databases.

If you have finished this workshop early and want to experiment some more,
we have additional exercises you can try out using our online interactive
learning environment.
